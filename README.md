### 📄 Project Overview

The Events is a simple project focused on frontend design and layout skills to properly showcase what an events planning business landing page can offer in terms of its services for quick navigation of any potential client. Developed as part of the Lasallian Codespace Bootcamp sessions, this project demonstrates the ability to structure and style desktop web pages using HTML and CSS, without the use of JavaScript frameworks.
